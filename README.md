# flatpak-builder-lint

flatpak-builder-lint is a linter for Flatpak artifacts like Flatpak
manifests, Flatpak Builder build artifacts and repos. It is primarily
developed for Flathub, but can be useful for general use as well.

## Checks

There are four checks available right now - the `appstream` check, the
`manifest` check, the `builddir` check and the `repo` check. The manifest
and the repo checks are run on Flathub infrastructure.

- The `appstream` check expects path to a [Metainfo file](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/metainfo-guidelines/#path-and-filename)
  as input. This is a wrapper for `appstreamcli validate` with some
  Flathub specific overrides.
- The `manifest` check expects path to a [Flatpak manifest](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html)
  as input.
- The `builddir` check expects path to a build directory generated by
  Flatpak Builder as input.
- The `repo` check expects path to an OSTree repository exported by
  Flatpak Builder as input.

The last two are created when [building the application](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission#build-and-install)
with the proper arguments to Flatpak Builder.

Some checks may require network connectivity. Sentry integration is used
only if `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is set.

## Exceptions

Errors can be overridden through exceptions.

Exceptions must be [submitted to Flathub](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/linter#exceptions)
if the app is meant to be published on Flathub or already exists on
Flathub.

### Local exceptions

This option should be used sparingly as some errors should never be
ignored and it may hide errors that will fail on Flathub.

For ignoring errors locally (for example in CI outside Flathub),
the `--user-exceptions` argument can be used to point it to a local
JSON file containing exceptions:

```sh
flatpak-builder-lint --exceptions --user-exceptions exceptions.json {manifest,builddir,repo} path
```

The JSON file must be in the following format:

```json
{
    "com.foo.Bar.Devel": [
        "linter-error-1"
    ],
    "com.foo.Bar.Nightly": [
        "linter-error-2"
    ]
}
```

If it is passed only local exceptions loaded from the file, matching the
app ID will be used, otherwise it will use remote exceptions from
Flathub.

## Installation

The only supported ways to install and use are Flatpak and Docker.

### Flatpak

flatpak-builder-lint is part of the `org.flatpak.Builder` flatpak package
available on Flathub. [Set up FlatHub][flatpak_setup] first, then install
`org.flatpak.Builder`:

```bash
flatpak install flathub -y org.flatpak.Builder
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder --help

# Run the manifest check
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder manifest com.foo.bar.json

# Run the repo check
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder repo repo
```

The Flatpak package tracks the git commit currently used on the Flathub
infrastructure.

### Docker

The latest build of flatpak-builder-linter can be used with Docker.

```bash
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint:latest --help

# Run the manifest check
docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt --rm -it ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint:latest manifest /mnt/com.foo.bar.json

# Run the repo check
docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt --rm -it ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint:latest repo /mnt/repo
```

You may need to pass `:Z` if your distro is using SELinux like so
`-v $(pwd):/mnt:Z`.

### Local environment

Installing flatpak-builder-lint locally with [uv][uv] or pip is
not recommended unless for development purposes. It depends on patches
that are found in the `org.flatpak.Builder` flatpak package
and on external tools.

## Contributing

The following system dependencies must be installed:

- `libgirepository1.0-dev, gir1.2-ostree-1.0, gir1.2-appstream-1.0`
- `flatpak-builder` for validating flatpak-builder manifests
- `appstreamcli` from `org.flatpak.Builder` for validating MetaInfo files
```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec flatpak run --branch=stable --command=appstreamcli org.flatpak.Builder ${@}
```
- `desktop-file-validate` to validate desktop files
- `git` to check if a directory is a git repository

Debiab/Ubuntu:

```
# apt install git appstream flatpak-builder libgirepository1.0-dev gir1.2-ostree-1.0 gir1.2-appstream-1.0 libcairo2-dev desktop-file-utils
```

ArchLinux:

```
# pacman -S --needed git appstream flatpak-builder desktop-file-utils ostree glib2
```

Fedora:

```
# dnf install git appstream flatpak-builder desktop-file-utils ostree-libs glib2-devel cairo-devel
```

Then the project can be installed with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint.git && cd flatpak-builder-lint
uv run --all-groups --frozen -q flatpak-builder-lint --help
```

Dependencies can be added to removed with `uv add` and `uv remove` while
`uv lock` will regenerate the lockfile. `uv lock -P` can be used to
upgrade a specific package or `uv lock -U` to upgrade everything.

The following Python dependencies are installed and needed to run the
project: `jsonschema, requests, requests-cache, lxml, sentry-sdk`
and `PyGObject`. Additionally `setuptools` is necessary to build the
project. `dunamai` is used to generate a version from the git commit,
since no tags or releases are done, in absence of which it will default
to the version of the last tag made.

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/) is used to lint and
format code. [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html)
is used to check Python types. To run them:

```sh
# Formatting
uv run ruff format --check

# Linting
uv run ruff check

# Auto fix some lint errrors
uv run ruff check --fix

# Check python types
uv run mypy .
```

A pre-commit hook is provided to automate the formatting and linting:

```sh
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Uninstall hooks
uv run pre-commit uninstall
```

### Tests

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html) is used
to run tests.

```sh
uv run pytest -v tests
```

Tests can also be run inside a container using `docker` or `podman`
after making changes to the project.

```sh
docker build --no-cache-filter=image -t linter:dev -q -f tests/Dockerfile . && docker run -it --rm linter:dev pytest -vvv
```

An additional Flat manager test can be run when modifying code relying
on the flatmanager check. The test is meant to be run on CI and not
locally. If it is being run locally, it must be run from the root of the
git repository using

```sh
./tests/flatmanager.sh

# Avoid repeated rebuilds
NO_CLEAN_UP=1 ./tests/flatmanager.sh
```

To write tests for manifest checks, recreate a minimal Flatpak builder
manifest with the cases to check against and put it in `tests/manifests`.
Then add the test using it (or modify the existing tests) in
`tests/test_manifest.py`.

Similarly to add a test for builddir check, recreate the `metadata`,
cataloge, metainfo, desktop files as needed and put them in a
subdirectory of `tests/builddir`. Then add the test in
`tests/test_builddir.py`. There are helper functions in
`tests/test_builddir.py` to emulate a flatpak-builder build directory
using the source files.

Please avoid adding binary files that aren't readable.
